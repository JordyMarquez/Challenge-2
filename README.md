# Challenge-2
## Description
The purpose of this challenge was to create a functional website from scratch to act as a portfolio of our work. A responsive layout was created with functional links to external websites of past projects. To do this several flex boxes were added into HTML containers to customize in the CSS stylesheet. Other CSS properties were added to stylize the website to appear closer to the mockup given.
